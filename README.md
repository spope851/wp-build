# WordPress Build Project

A modern WordPress development setup using Composer for dependency management and a clean build process.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Clone and Build
```bash
git clone <your-repo>
cd wp-build
./build.sh
```

### 2. Set up WordPress Configuration
The build script does not generate `wp-config.php`. You need to:

**For Development:**
- Copy `wordpress/wp-config-sample.php` to `wordpress/wp-config.php`
- Update database credentials and security keys

**For Production/Deployment:**
- Your deployment environment should handle `wp-config.php`
- DeployHQ or similar services can manage environment-specific configuration

### 3. Start Development Server
```bash
php -S localhost:8000 -t wordpress/
```

Visit http://localhost:8000 to complete WordPress installation.

## 📁 Project Structure

```

├── composer.lock          # Locked versions (committed)
├── .gitignore            # Ignores generated files
├── build.php             # Build script
├── build.sh              # Build shell script
├── src/                  # Your custom code (committed)
│   ├── bootstrap.php     # WordPress initialization

```

## 🔧 Development Workflow

### Adding Plugins
```bash
composer require wpackagist-plugin/plugin-name
./build.sh
```

### Adding Custom Code
1. Add your classes to `src/`
2. Initialize them in `src/bootstrap.php`
3. The code is automatically loaded by WordPress

### Rebuilding WordPress
```bash
./build.sh
```

This completely rebuilds the WordPress installation from Composer dependencies.

## 🎯 Key Features

- **Composer-managed**: All dependencies managed through Composer
- **Clean builds**: Entire WordPress installation rebuilt from scratch
- **Custom code**: Your code in `src/` automatically loaded
- **Version controlled**: Only source code and configuration committed
- **Deployment ready**: Environment handles WordPress configuration
- **Development ready**: Debug mode enabled, file editing disabled

## 📦 Installed Plugins

- **WooCommerce**: E-commerce functionality
- **Contact Form 7**: Contact forms
- **Yoast SEO**: Search engine optimization

## 🛠️ Custom Code

Your custom code goes in the `src/` directory and is automatically loaded by WordPress.

### Example Custom Feature
```php
// src/Features/SocialSharing.php
namespace Spenpo\WpBuild\Features;

class SocialSharing {
    public function __construct() {
        add_filter('the_content', [$this, 'add_social_buttons']);
    }
}
```

### Initializing Custom Code
```php
// src/bootstrap.php
new Features\SocialSharing();
```

## 🧪 Testing

### Run Build Tests
```bash
php test-build.php
```

### Run Source Code Tests
```bash
php test-src.php
```

### Test Without Database
```bash
php test-no-db.php
```

## 🔄 Build Process

The build script (`build.php`) does the following:

1. **Cleans up**: Removes existing WordPress installation
2. **Installs dependencies**: Runs `composer install`
3. **Sets up structure**: Organizes files in `wordpress/` directory
4. **Creates directories**: Sets up uploads, cache, etc.
5. **Sets permissions**: Ensures proper file permissions
6. **Verifies installation**: Checks all required files exist

**Note**: `wp-config.php` is not generated by the build script. The environment should handle WordPress configuration.

## 🚫 What's Ignored

The `.gitignore` file excludes:
- `wordpress/` - Entire WordPress installation
- `vendor/` - Composer packages
- `composer.lock` - Optional (some teams commit this)
- Uploads, cache, and logs
- Environment-specific files

## 🔒 Security

- WordPress configuration is handled by the environment
- File editing is disabled in admin
- Automatic updates are disabled
- Debug logging is enabled for development

## 🚀 Deployment

### DeployHQ Setup
1. Connect your repository to DeployHQ
2. Set build command: `./build.sh`
3. Configure environment variables for database credentials
4. DeployHQ will handle `wp-config.php` generation

### Environment Variables
Your deployment environment should set:
- `DB_NAME`
- `DB_USER`
- `DB_PASSWORD`
- `DB_HOST`
- WordPress security keys
